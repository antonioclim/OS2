# FUNCTION: Read Vector Elements from a File into an Array
# =========================================
# This function reads the contents of a given file and stores each line as an element in an array.
# The array is passed by reference, meaning it can be modified inside the function.
# Requires Bash version 4.3+ for the "local -n" feature (name references).

preluare_vector_1() {
    local nume_fisier="$1"  # Store the filename (first argument)
    local -n arr=$2         # Reference to the array provided as second argument
    local i=0               # Counter to keep track of array indices

    # =========================================
    # READ FILE LINE BY LINE AND STORE IN ARRAY
    # =========================================
    # IFS= prevents leading/trailing whitespace from being removed.
    # read -r prevents the backslash `\` from being treated as an escape character.
    while IFS= read -r line || [[ -n "$line" ]]; do
        arr[i++]="$line"  # Assign the line content to the array and increment index
    done < "$nume_fisier"
}

# =========================================
# MAIN SCRIPT EXECUTION
# =========================================

# Prompt the user to enter the filename to read
echo -n "Enter the name of the file to read from: "
read nume_fisier  # Read filename input from the user

declare -a a  # Declare an array 'a' to store the file contents

# Call the function to read the file and populate the array
preluare_vector_1 "$nume_fisier" a  

# =========================================
# PRINTING THE ARRAY ELEMENTS
# =========================================
# Loop through the array and print each element formatted as a floating-point number with one decimal place
echo "Contents of the file as numbers:"
for (( i = 0; i < ${#a[@]}; i++ )); do
    printf "%4.1f ," "${a[i]}"
done
echo  # Print a newline at the end for better output formatting
